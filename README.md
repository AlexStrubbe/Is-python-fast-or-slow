Is-python-fast-or-slow
===============================
### Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to visualize the importance of using Python libraries, particularly NumPy, for array operations. We aim to compare the processing time of performing array products using native Python code (with iteration) versus using NumPy operations.

### Methodology:
1) Python (Using Iteration):
Write Python code to carry out the product of 1-D and 2-D arrays with compatible dimensions.
Time the execution for various cases:
Small arrays with dimensionalities less than 10
Arrays with dimensionalities in the range of several tens
Arrays with dimensionalities in the range of several hundreds
Try multiple combinations of products of arrays.
2) NumPy Operations:
Import NumPy and use its operations to perform the same array products as in step 1.
Time the execution for the same cases.
### Analysis:
Compare the results obtained from Python with iteration versus NumPy operations.
Explain the reason for the difference in processing time.
Utilize appropriate tables and graphics for comparison.
Analyze how processing time grows with the dimensionalities of the arrays.
Compare processing time variations between vectors (1-D arrays) and matrices (2-D arrays) without NumPy versus with NumPy.
Investigate the development language of NumPy and its impact on performance.
